-   ## Title of the project

prepared by:

-   ## problem overview

What is the problem !

What is The objective of the project !

We will examine who is effected by this problem !

How we can decrease the chances of getting this problem by some
preventive measures !

-   ## Solution process

### Discuss about The Data:

 1- where you get your data set

2- what your data set has

3- how many features it has

4- the explanation of the data set

5- what kind of columns it says like:( Demographic, History, etcâ€¦)

### Analyze The Data :

what do you analyze like: (Heterogeneous population, Anomaly detection,
Missing value treatment, create new variables upon mutual
relation(feature engineering))

### Analytical approach:

What kind of analytical approach did you use like:(supervised ML or
unsupervised ML, etc...)

Model preparation:

how you prepare the model like: (we teach the model on the training data
set)

### Model validation:

1- how you validate the model!

2- how you can check the performance of the model !

3- how it is predicting !

-   ## Models comparison

How each model is performing on training data** **and testing data.

-   ## key finding

It is the most important factor that influence through the problem and
number them in order .

-   ## preventive measures

You can discuss the preventive measure and what kind of preventive areas
you can take to avoid the problem or reduce the disease or fraud
detection.

-   ## Recommendation

Give recommendation upon your model prediction and explain your
recommendations.

-   ## Potential benefits

What kind of potential benefits are given (The sense of the business) it
should be at least three.
